# Weighted-sum-of-sinusoids
This project demonstrates the Fourier series approximation of a square wave using the summation of multiple sine waves. The implementation is done using Python and visualized with Matplotlib.

## Features
- Generates sine waves and combines them to approximate a square wave.
- Uses `numpy` for mathematical operations.
- Uses `matplotlib` to visualize the Fourier series approximation.
- Demonstrates the effect of adding more harmonics to improve the square wave approximation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How It Works
1. The script initializes a time array and fundamental frequency.
2. It generates sine waves with different harmonics and amplitudes.
3. The waves are summed to approximate a square wave.
4. The resulting waveform is plotted using Matplotlib.

## Files
- `Internship_Day_NINE_.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the Fourier series implementation with explanations.

## Future Enhancements
- Add interactive controls to adjust the number of harmonics dynamically.
- Implement real-time signal visualization.
- Compare Fourier approximations with different waveforms (triangle, sawtooth, etc.).
